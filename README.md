## Why Blogly?

Blogly was developed since there was no free and reliable popular blogging tools, particularly for Blogger, that was available at the time of development. Also, most of the software available at the time of development lacked the stability and various features that were essential for a content creator to aid in various stages of drafting to publishing. 

Blogly has also enabled the author(s) to meaningfully contribute towards open source community and free software ecosystem.
